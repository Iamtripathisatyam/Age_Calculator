### Prerequisite:
```python
        ~ pip install python-dateutil
        ~ pip install plyer
```
             
### Module needed:
```python 
          from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
          from datetime import datetime
          from time import strptime
          from plyer import notification
          import os 
```
### Use of `plyer` module:
   - Used as a Desktop Notifier. 
   - It produces a Notification Message in form of a POP-UP Message on Desktop.
### Use of `os` module:
   - This Module in python provides functions for interacting with the Operating System. 
   - It produces a Notification Message in form of a POP-UP Message on Desktop.
### Use of `datetime` module:
   - This Module supplies classes to work with date and time.
   - These classes provide a number of functions to deal with dates, times and time intervals.
### Use of `dateutil.relativedelta` module:
   - The relativedelta type is designed to be applied to an existing datetime.
   - It can replace specific components of that datetime, or represents an interval of time.
### Use of `time` module:
   - This Module provides many ways of representing time in code, such as objects, numbers, and strings. 
   - It also provides functionality other than representing time, like waiting during code execution and measuring the efficiency of your code.
