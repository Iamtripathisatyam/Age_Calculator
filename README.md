# PreRequisite:
```python
            ~ pip install python-dateutil
            ~ pip install plyer
```
             
# Module Needed:
```python 
              from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
              from datetime import datetime
              from time import strptime
              from plyer import notification
              import os 
```
# Use of **`plyer`** Module:
```python
       1. Used as a Desktop Notifier. 
       2. It produces a Notification Message in form of a POP-UP Message on Desktop.
```
# Use of **`os`** Module:
```python
       1. This Module in python provides functions for interacting with the Operating System. 
       2. It produces a Notification Message in form of a POP-UP Message on Desktop.
```
# Use of **`time`** Module:
```python
       1. This Module provides many ways of representing time in code, such as objects, numbers, and strings. 
       2. It also provides functionality other than representing time, like waiting during code execution and measuring the efficiency of your code.
```
# Use of **`datetime`** Module:
```python
       1. This Module supplies classes to work with date and time.
       2. These classes provide a number of functions to deal with dates, times and time intervals.
```
# Use of **`dateutil.relativedelta`** Module:
```python
       1. The relativedelta type is designed to be applied to an existing datetime.
       2. It can replace specific components of that datetime, or represents an interval of time.
```
